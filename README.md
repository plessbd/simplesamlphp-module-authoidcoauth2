# simplesamlphp-module-authoidcoauth2
A simplesamlphp module to connect to OIDC endpoints using OAuth2

If you are seeing this, you probably shouldn't be using it, it was created specifially for use with [OpenXDMoD](https://open.xdmod.org) due to an old version of php and simplesamlphp.

You should probably instead use something like https://github.com/cirrusidentity/simplesamlphp-module-authoauth2
